									<p>As part of my freelancing work, I worked on building a new website for the <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/">Frank Ratchye STUDIO For Creative Inquiry</a> along with designer <a href="http://www.anna-gusman.com/">Anna Gusman</a>, who created the layout and visual identity of the site, and frontend engineer <a href="https://www.paulpengdotcom.com/">Paul Peng</a> who implemented the layout as a Wordpress theme.</p>

									<p>My responsibilites on this project included the maintenance of a wordpress instance and web server, data migration from the old site, coordination between designer and front-end engineer for planning the architecture of the siteâ€™s implementation, and writing documentation and training several others on how to update and maintain the website.</p>

									<p>The website is currently live at <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/">studioforcreativeinquiry.org</a>.</p>
