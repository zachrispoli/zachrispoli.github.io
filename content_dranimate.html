									<p>In the summers of 2016 and 2017, I worked in a art and technology lab at CMU on an experimental interactive performance system called Dranimate.</p>

										<h2>How does it work?</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Drawings are placed under a webcam/lighting rig which captures an image of the drawing. A computer-vision system processes the image and creates a two-dimensional mesh that can be squished and stretched using an algorithm called <a href="https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/">As Rigid as Possible</a>. These virtual puppets are then rigged and controlled with hand gestures by using a <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/">Leap Motion Controller</a>.</p>

									<p>For more technical information on Dranimate, take a look at <em><a href="UIST 2015 - Dranimate: Rapid Real-time Gestural Rigging and Control of Animation">Dranimate: Rapid Real-time Gestural Rigging and Control of Animation (UIST 2015)</a></em>.</p>

									<p>My role at Dranimate was leading development and design of the software system. I was also responsible for instructing several interns on how to contribute to the codebase and teaching various C++, computer vision, and computer graphics concepts.</p>

									<p>I also often acted as the Dranimate Puppeteer at various test sites and performances - see the vieo above!</p>
