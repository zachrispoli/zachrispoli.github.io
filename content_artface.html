									<p>In this live action collage event, guests were prompted to explore a museum and choose paintings and sculptures from the collection for a unique remix experience.</p>

									<p>At the #ARTFACE booth, guests chose their favorite works to step inside of. Paintings became backgrounds, and sculptures and portraits became masks. <a href="http://www.clairesophie.com/">Claire</a> was able to source images of the paintings for the backgrounds, and also 3D-scanned many museum artifcats that we used to create 3D models for the masks!</p>

									<p>The goal of this interaction was to encourage guests to explore the works in a collection as potential elements for a personalized remix, and update older works of art by re-inhabiting them digitally. At the end of the live remix experience, guests were given a digital print of their unique work of art, featuring themselves.</p>
