									<p>As part of the Google Summer of Code open-source internship program, I contributed to <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible to artists, designers, educators, and beginners.</p>

									<p>My contributions were to the <a href="https://medium.com/processing-foundation/hello-p5-js-web-editor-b90b902b74cf">p5.js Web Editor</a>, a free browser-based editor for p5.js.</p>

									<p>I contributed several bugfixes, as well as a design for an online collaboration system that would have been used in classrooms to keep track of assignments and projects using the web editor.</p>
